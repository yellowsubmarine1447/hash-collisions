This is the secret confession of Richard Buckland 
to be revealed by anonymous email if I should 
mysteriously vanish.  I have left the last few hex
digits of the SHA256 hash of this message with my
trusted solicitor, Dennis Denuto, which will verify 
that this is indeed my intended and unaltered 
confession written by me Richard Buckland.
 
Dennis has not seen this confession he has only seen 
the last few digits of the hash.  I have also sent copies
of the last few digits to my bank manager and to my priest 
Father Brown. 
 
On the 10th of February I saw Mark Zukerberg peeping
through my window and recording my private and personal 
conversation with my friend.
 
I confronted him and he was very embarrassed.  He
promised to pay me $1 million a year if I would stay
silent and not tell anyone I had seen him do this.  I
agreed but now I worry that it would be cheaper for him 
to make me vanish than to keep paying me.
